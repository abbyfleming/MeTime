###Inspiration
>I have come to believe that caring for myself is not self indulgent. Caring for myself is an act of survival. -Audre Lourde

###Overview

A single page CRUD application that allows Users to save, create, and edit self care cards that remind them to take care of themselves. 

A set of cards would be pre-populated and would have ideas such as: binge watch Netflix, take a hike, call a friend. The user would be able to save favorites and delete favorites. A user can also create their own cards, then edit and delete their own cards.

### Goals
1. Sharpen my skills using Angular
2. Become more familiar with Firebase by creating my own set of data instead of using an API
3. Use SASS and Bootstrap for styling
