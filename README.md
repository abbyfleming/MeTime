### Overview

A single page CRUD application that allows Users to save, create, and edit self care cards that remind them to take care of themselves. 

A set of cards would be pre-populated and would have ideas such as: binge watch Netflix, take a hike, call a friend. The user would be able to save favorites and delete favorites. A user can also create their own cards, then edit and delete their own cards.
